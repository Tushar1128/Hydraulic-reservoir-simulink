Hydraulic Reservoir with Oil Metering System

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project presents a Simulink-based simulation of a **10-liter hydraulic reservoir integrated with an intelligent oil metering system**. The objective is to design a system that ensures prioritized oil distribution to critical subsystems under varying fluid conditionsâ€”mimicking real-world aerospace, automotive, and industrial hydraulic applications.

The system is modeled with two primary components:
- **Flight Control Unit** (critical system)
- **Utility Block** (non-critical system)

Under normal conditions, oil is distributed to both units. However, when oil volume drops below 2 liters, the system automatically cuts off the supply to the Utility Block while continuing uninterrupted flow to the Flight Control Unit.
Key Features
